# Excel Report Maker
This MS Access form tool summarizes excel data in tables into a one view sortable report

The MS Access form was orginially written by TheSmileyCoder on [Utter Access] (http://www.utteraccess.com/forum/Searching-Tables-t2000459.html)<br>
The orignial tool could look through various excel file and show the location and table of where the search term came from. Also there was only one keyword that could be entered.

# Revisions in Version 2.0.
The original code was modified by Basil Khan to get the field names and fields values for the search term, transpose the data and display all the data in on column to be able to sort through using filters in Excel. This can help in making summarized excel sheets with the relevant data all in one place.<br>

To use the tool, please enter the keyword in the search box(es), choose your search options and click search. The search tool can take anywhere from 2 to 10 mins to search based on number of keywords and amount being extracted from documents. The data can be later exported into excel using the export button on one of the forms. To view this button, change the views of the form to make it non-Datasheet view. The form is available in MS Access. The code has also been exported into two .cls files to easily view the code.
